# MolecularAdsorption
This is a C-Bash code to generate initial configurations for the study of adsorption of molecules in metallic clusters
There are available two versions: for clusters and for substrates, the first one is recommended when the metallic cluster studied is small (less than 100 atoms) and it is aproximatly spheric, if it is too large, a better aproximation is to trate it like a surface, for that case exists  the substrate version, that works similarly than the other but adapted to a plane surface.
