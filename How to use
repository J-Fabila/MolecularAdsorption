The program generates a master directory, this contains a directory for every configuration, each one contains INCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS  and POSCAR file, ready to run.
Open the adsorption.sh file with any text editor (e.g. Vi). Edit the input data. Each variable will be explained in  next section.

Nit: Is the number of configurations over each point around the cluster
Ntheta: Number of steps around the cluster in theta (usual spherical coordinates)
Nphi: Number of steps around the cluster in phi (usual spherical coordinates)

rsep : Maximum separation between the cluster  surface and molecule

Project_Name: The nme of the master directory before mentioned
Pseudo_Dir: The path where the VASP-pseudopotentials are located. The program use this path to generate to POTCAR file
pseudotype:      For example, if you want to use  the GW Gold VASP pseudopotential  (Au_GW) just write _GW [pseudotype=_GW]
                 If  you want to use the "Au_sv_GW" pseudopotential write "pseudoype=_sv_GW"  or blank for PBE
Scale_factor: For POSCAR file
Vect1, Vect2, Vect3: Row vectors of matrix cell. Necessaries for POSCAR file.


For example:

Vect1=" 35.0000000   0.0000000    0.0000000  "  
Vect2=" 0.0000000   35.0000000    0.0000000  "
Vect3=" 0.0000000   0.0000000    35.0000000  "

IncarFile: This is path of  the INCAR file you want to use for your calculations. Will be copied to every directory 
KpointsFile: Idem
The  atomic positions will be readed  from molecule.xyz and cluster.xyz. Copy the coordinates to these files
